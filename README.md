## 4. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)
- **Design Principles:** NO PLAN FOR NOW

## 5. Budget and Resources
- **Cost:** The cost will be depending on the decision if I will publish it on Google Play, and if I will upgrade the database for larger scale.
- **Skills and Team:** The skills that will be learned from the roadmap I track will take effect on this project. Since this is my personal project, I will be making this application without the help of other developers.

- **Testing:** The testing will be made for each changes I made.

## 7. Data and Privacy
- **Data Storage:** During the creation of the foundation of the app (components, views), the data will be stored via **.json** format. Later on, the data are being kept on the cloud storage (Firebase)
- **Privacy:** The data is protected by encryption stored in the database if the project has been developed.

## 8. Maintenance and Updates

- **Version Control:**  There will be a version control for developer and the production.

## 9. Legal Considerations
